        question: "1. What is XIRCLS?",
        answer:
        "XIRCLS is the world’s first cross-marketing software & merchant network where you can instantly partner with non-competing businesses and directly market to each other’s customers."
    },
    {
        question: "2. Why is it called XIRCLS?",
        answer:
        "XIRCLS is a nod to the word ‘circles’ which forms the core ability of the software i.e. it enables online & offline merchants to connect, form a ‘XIRCL’ of partners and directly market to each others’ customers for more efficient customer acquisition & retention.\n\n                                                        XIRCLS is also an acronym for Integrated Cross-Marketing, Rewards & Customer Loyalty Solution (the X stands for the Cross in Cross-Marketing)."
    },
    {
        question:
        "3. So XIRCLS is basically about cross-promotion between merchants, right?",
        answer:
        "Yes, but it’s a whole lot more. XIRCLS breaks the physical boundaries of traditional cross-promotion - which is severely limited to your personal network & draws heavily from your marketing budget - and expands it from your immediate neighborhood to across the city, country or even the entire world.\n\n                                                    Now ANY online or offline merchant can use the software to connect with each other and kick off a 100% automated cross-marketing campaign for a minimal budget, within minutes."
    },
    {
        question:
        "4. What makes XIRCLS more effective than other kinds of marketing campaigns?",
        answer:
        "Other marketing campaigns are limited in their reach and effectiveness by the efforts or resources put in by the individual merchant himself. A local marketing campaign can only reach out to consumers in the outlet’s immediate area of influence. A medium-sized business is limited by its marketing budget in doling out offers to attract & retain customers. A social media marketing campaign is only as effective as the money an individual merchant can afford to invest for reach & conversions. Even a large corporation cannot create customized marketing campaigns based on the city, area or locality of the consumer or present its offers at the most relevant moment for the consumer i.e. at the moment of purchase.\n\n                                                    In contrast, XIRCLS uses cross-marketing as its base and breaks the physical boundaries of traditional cross-promotion, no longer limiting you to your personal network. Instead, the software makes it possible for online & offline outlets from across the city, country or even the world to promote each other to their customers through personalised recommendations. This way, the XIRCLS software leverages the power of compounding returns to benefit its merchants."
    },
    {
        question: "5. How does XIRCLS leverage cross-marketing to benefit me?",
        answer:
        "XIRCLS leverages digital cross-marketing as its base to deliver key benefits to its merchants:\n\n                                                        Since the cross-marketing partnership is virtual, merchants can expand their marketing reach in minutes and forge partnerships locally, citywide or even across the country.\n                                                        Customer delight is maximised by allowing issuance of offers from a diverse range of merchants on purchase, not easy for an individual merchant to do by himself.\n                                                        Promotional offers reach the consumer when interest is at its peak i.e. at the moment of purchase. Merchants can also partner together to give offers to customers that are relevant & timely e.g. a club can choose to partner with a taxi service or a restaurant can partner with an ice-cream parlour."
    },
    {
        question: "6. How is XIRCLS different from coupon websites / apps?",
        answer:
        "XIRCLS is NOT a coupon distribution platform where your offers are merely displayed on a single platform for the purpose of acquiring customers. It is a cross-marketing software for you to partner with other merchants and get directly recommended to their customers via emails sent straight to their inboxes, guaranteeing more targeted and effective reach. It also enables you to create offers exclusively for new customer acquisition, while customers who’ve already shopped with you before receive offers specially designed for retention.\n\n                                                    Here are some other fundamental differences between coupon websites / apps & XIRCLS:\n\n                                                        TARGETING: XIRCLS facilitates high quality consumer targeting by giving you control over who is receiving your offers, via your Preferred Partners (A higher level of precision targeting is also available to Professional plan users through Inner XIRCLs).\n\n                                                        This ensures that your marketing messages reach your target customer base and are not wasted on deal-hunting consumers who will be one-time customers at best, as is the case on coupon platforms.\n                                                        LOYALTY: Coupon platforms focus on one-time redemption, giving no assurance of customer loyalty to their merchants. XIRCLS places equal importance on customer acquisition & retention, thus cultivating customer loyalty in the long run.\n\n                                                        AUTOMATED: From the customer’s end, coupon platforms require consumers to constantly be on the hunt for attractive offers and apply them manually. With XIRCLS, relevant offers are directly sent to the consumer at the time of purchase, depending on where he has purchased from, his location, his spend etc. The customer is also reminded of redeemable offers while shopping and can apply an offer with a single click - no coupon codes to be entered!"
    },
    {
        question: "7. How is XIRCLS different from any CRM software?",
        answer:
        "Customer relationship management (CRM) is an approach to managing a business's interaction with its customers.\n\n                                                    XIRCLS is a LOT more than just a customer relationship management tool, although it has the basic features of any CRM software in-built. XIRCLS functions as a cross-marketing + rewards & loyalty programme + customer communication tool. It helps you combine your marketing efforts geared towards attracting new customers with those targeted at retaining customers who’ve already shopped with you."
    },
    {
        question: "8. Is XIRCLS also a loyalty management software?",
        answer:
        "Since XIRCLS also focuses on customer retention after acquisition, it includes several features that would coincide with standard loyalty management softwares.\n\n                                                    However, XIRCLS goes a step ahead to streamline your marketing efforts by helping you manage & track customer acquisition and loyalty on a single platform."

        "2. I sell my products/services on a third party platform (Amazon, eBay, Etsy). Can I cross-market on XIRCLS?",

        "Unfortunately, no. XIRCLS is currently only available to businesses who sell their products / services directly to end consumers via their own e-commerce website / mobile app and can install the XIRCLS plugin / SDK into their platform. Since such installations are not possible on third-party platforms, you won’t be able to cross-market on XIRCLS through such channels."

The Admin can then go on to add a Company & create an Outlet profile associated with this account."

        question: "1. Why must I add my company?",
        answer:
        "Since XIRCLS is a marketing collaboration platform for businesses, it’s crucial for our merchants to feel confident that they’re interacting with genuine companies on the network. That is why we make it mandatory for merchants to add a company before they can create an outlet profile on the network. Your company details - as displayed on your Outlet profile - reassure merchants that they’re collaborating with a bonafide company."

Your Company is different from your Outlet, which is the website/mobile app or physical location where customers can buy your Company's products or services.\n\n                                                    e.g. If you sell apparel manufactured under the legally registered name of Creative Apparels Pvt.

It leads to the immediate deletion of all Outlets associated with this Company, as well as all campaigns associated with these Outlets. Issuance of all Reward Kits, Acquisition Offers and Retention Offers will stop immediately. Company deletion is permanent and if you wish to return to XIRCLS, you will have to add your Company and create your Outlet profile/s all over again.\n\n                                                    Note: All Offers issued by Outlets associated with this Company until the point of deletion will continue to be redeemable by customers till these offers expire.

        "Blocking an outlet means to guarantee that it will not be allowed to cross-market with you on any campaign. It essentially means that rewards from this outlet will NEVER be issued to customers who make a purchase at your Outlet. Also, your Offers will NEVER be issued to customers who make a purchase at this outlet.\n                                                      \n                                                      Blocking an outlet ensures its exclusion when our AI-driven algorithms auto-match you with compatible outlets in your cross-marketing campaign for relevant offer/reward distribution."

        "Semper Fi gives you the freedom to create 4 types of offers, depending on your product/service and the type of discount you want to give.\n\n                                                        1. Flat Discount Offer \n                                                        2. Percentage Discount Offer \n                                                        3. Free Products/Service/Voucher \n                                                        4. Buy One Get One Free"
    },
    {
        question: "3. How many Loyalty Offers should I create?",
        answer:
        "We would recommend creating at least 3 Loyalty Offers that cover different customer spend ranges. E.g. If you’ve created a Percentage Discount Offer of 15% off on spend of Rs.1000-Rs.2500, create another offer that covers a lower spend range, such as Rs.300-Rs.999. This will ensure there is an attractive offer for every kind of customer who shops with you."
    },
    {
        question:
        "4. How do I know which Loyalty Offer my customer will receive?",
        answer:
        "Loyalty Offers are issued based on how much the customer has just spent at your outlet. E.g. If you have two offers - 10% off on spend of Rs.500-Rs.1000 and Rs.300 off on spend of Rs.1000-Rs.2500 - and your customer has just spent Rs.600 at your outlet, she will receive the 10% off offer.\n\n                                                    However, when the customer logs into your outlet website to redeem her offer, she will see both offers and can choose to redeem any one."
    },
    {
        question:
        "5. Why does the customer see all my Loyalty Offers when she logs into my outlet website?",
        answer:
        "Displaying all Loyalty Offers to your logged-in returning customers is an upselling technique to encourage your customers to spend more or buy a particular product/service to enjoy more savings. Note: The customer can redeem only one Loyalty Offer while checking out."
    },
    {
        question:
        "6. Will my Loyalty Offers be displayed to a user who’s never shopped with me before and is logged in for the first time?",
        answer:
        "No. Your Loyalty Offers will never be displayed to visitors who are making their first purchase on the website."
    },
    {
        question:
        "7. Will my campaign keep running if all my Loyalty Offers expire?",
        answer:
        "At least one active Loyalty Offer is mandatory to run a Semper Fi campaign. If all your Loyalty Offers expire, your campaign will automatically stop. To resume the campaign, you must create a new Loyalty Offer or update offer validity on your existing offer/s."

It is ideal for small businesses looking for an automated loyalty solution with minimal involvement or for budding digital marketers who want to keep things simple to start with.\n\n                                                    The Grow Plan costs Rs.999/month and is ideal for businesses looking to scale up and grow. It allows you to get more in-depth in your cross-marketing strategy and fine-tune your campaign to push for greater conversions.\n\n                                                    The Grow Plan allows you to create upto 2 users, block upto 5 outlets, create more types of offers, get email template options (3 only), retarget via your partners, send offer reminders and create an exclusive Inner XIRCL (1 only) with your choice of partners.\n\n                                                    The Grow Plan also includes email + phone support, more detailed reports/analytics, data backups and disaster recovery.\n\n                                                    The Pro Plan costs Rs.1799/month and is recommended for larger companies seeking partner exclusivity in their cross-marketing campaigns and who need advanced customizations to suit their business needs.\n\n                                                    The Pro Plan is basically the Grow Plan on steroids. You can block upto 10 outlets, create 3 Inner XIRCLs for multi-level partnerships and create multiple outlets with upto 5 users with customizable user level settings. It also includes all the features from the Grow Plan, such as more types of offer creation, more email template options (10), retargeting via your partners and offer reminders.\n\n                                                    The Pro Plan includes email + phone support, detailed analytics and reports that include customer behaviour across partner outlets, data backups and disaster recovery.\n\n                                                    The Pro Plan also includes a personal alliances manager who will work closely with you to understand your business goals and partnership requirements.

In this case, SMS Packs are not compulsory but still highly recommended. \n\n                                                    However, if you’re a physical, offline outlet such as a store, restaurant, gym, etc., do not collect email addresses of customers and wish to deliver offers to your customers against their mobile number, offer delivery via SMS is the only option. In such a case, purchase of SMS Packs becomes mandatory."

Payment can be made via secure payment options available on your dashboard."
