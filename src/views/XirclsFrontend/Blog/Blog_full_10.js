                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>A few questions naturally arise for business owners and marketing managers when it comes to this sea-change in marketing operations. Broadly, the most asked questions are:</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify ps-2'>1. How will my business’ marketing operations cope with the cookieless internet and third-party deprecation?</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>Another of perhaps equal importance and inherently related to the first is:</p>

                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>And, if you’re reading this article, you probably want to know:</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify ps-2'>3. How can our business prepare for this monumental change, and how can we do it efficiently, with agility, and in a cost-effective way?</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>The unfortunate downside of this marketing revolution is that many people out there see the third-party armageddon as a way to make easy money off of confused business owners. In a world already rife with gurus that only provide insight at great expense and marketing firms that strive to protect their own bottom line, not always yours—promising huge returns while failing to mention the huge investment you’ll make with them and without taking into account your specific needs and values—it’s easy to feel like the world of marketing is just out to get you.</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>And that’s just the thing, once you adopt their strategies or use their services, <span className='fw-normal'>you’re beholden to them—you’re doing things <i>their way</i></span>. So, before getting lost in the quagmire of the many different strategies and schemes marketing firms are now suggesting to deal with the forthcoming changes to third-party data use, we want to teach you some fundamentals so that when all is said and done, you can judge the efficacy of our <span className="fw-normal">Collaborative Marketing</span> solution for yourself. </p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>We believe understanding the alternatives to third-party data is essential to assessing their relative advantages and the subsequent impact on your business, so we’ll tackle question 2 before we address the first one. After all, you and your team know your business best. You know what you want and what you stand for, and that’s what <span className="fw-normal">XIRCLS strives to preserve—your vision, your values, your way.</span></p>

                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>is data that is proactively shared with a brand, typically in exchange for some value bestowed upon the customer.</p>

You might think about or engage with these data types every day. But, while a working understanding of the internal back-end uses of these data sets works fine for producing marketing material, developing an empathetic understanding of how their usage actually looks and feels from your customer’s perspective is of the utmost importance. Especially if you want to develop a relevant and effective marketing strategy.</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>Unfortunately, this empathetic design is often overlooked in third through second-party—and even in first-party data implementation strategies, too. And that’s what really hurts marketing efficacy, ROIs, and conversions.</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>It should be clear now that <span className="fw-normal">effective marketing strategies after the death of third-party data are going to require an investment in <i>actually getting to know your customers.</i></span></p>

                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>There’s a problem with traditional customer data capture schemes. Namely, when impersonal data is recycled into targeted advertising and marketing content, it can feel, well…creepy. The general problem with these data sets is that when you’re grouped into a broad segment—in the case of third-party—or you’re targeted in an irrelevant and odd way—in the case of first-party data—the advertising message feels less like something you want to engage with, and more like you’re living in a surveillance state.</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>The ads just aren’t <span className="fw-normal">relevant.</span> They don’t make customers feel like they can’t live without your product, and the truth is they usually just end up making your prospective customers want to get as far away from you and your brand as quickly as possible.</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>This lack of genuine relevancy is why many business owners across varied industries often feel like their marketing dollars are being wasted or, at the very least, that their investments aren’t providing them with commensurate value.</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>It’s a big reason why, for example, when surveyed by Rakuten Marketing, businesses all over the world estimated that they waste, on average, <Link to='/' className="text-blue hover-black">26% of their marketing budgets.</Link></p>

                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>While Google’s announcement regarding third-party deprecation is certainly the attention grabber, it’s also important to consider just how ineffective utilising data from third all the way through to first-party can be, primarily when used in a way that doesn’t bring genuine relevance and value to customers.</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-normal text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>Companies and marketers in the surveys above may be rightfully worried about the fact that third-party data is going by the wayside, but shouldn’t they also be worried that even the ads they produce—using second and first-party data—often fall flat and alienate prospective customers? </p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>It’s probably happened to you. You’re talking about something—a product or a service, perhaps—with a friend or loved one, and then you open social media a few seconds later, and boom, there’s an ad for the exact thing you were just talking about. Now, this exact example might be a case of a user just getting worked up over <Link to='/' className="text-blue hover-black">confirmation bias</Link> , but it illustrates the problem with third-party and second-party data and, to a significant—and criminally underappreciated extent—first-party data as well.</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>The example of first-party data in the comic above might be fanciful, but would it really matter if it was a targeted ad about the shoes you browsed last year, over shoes you browsed last week, or even just an hour ago?</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>The point is, people don’t like to feel like they’re being watched. For the average internet shopper, it’s an all too familiar experience, browsing a pair of shoes or a piece of clothing, maybe adding an item to a shopping cart only to navigate away, leaving it in the retailer’s dreaded “abandoned cart” purgatory. Then, the next time you open your browser and scroll through other sites, there’s the product you didn’t buy, in every single ad you come across.</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-light text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>It feels like a not-so-subtle version of harassment and bullying that doesn’t serve your customer and turns them off your brand. You can probably think of a product or two that has hounded you in this way, and ask yourself…are you more likely to buy it someday?

The answer is right there, and it makes that kind of warm and fuzzy, intuitive sense when you stop to consider it:</p>
                        <p className='font-two fw-normal text-black lh-lg-md sixth-font-blog text-justify'>Utilising zero-party data that has been collected in a transparent process actually builds trust with your customers.

It’s genuine relevance because it confers genuine value. </p>
